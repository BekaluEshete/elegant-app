# ðŸ›’ Elegant Context Shopping Cart

A simple and elegant shopping cart app built with **React**, using `Context API` and `useReducer` for global state management.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This project demonstrates a modular and scalable way to handle a global shopping cart state using React's Context and `useReducer` hook. It allows users to:

- Add products to the cart
